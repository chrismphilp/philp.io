However, these are not the type that you saw in those classic James Bond movies, slowly advancing\n        to the hero&apos;s groin. These are known as <b>Q-switched lasers</b> and are the most common way to remove\n        tattoos. Before getting to the removal stage however, it is important to understand how tattoo&apos;s themselves\n        remain in the body.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Tattooing involves inserting ink into the dermal tissue layer of the skin (found under the epidermis – the\n        outermost layer of the skin). Once the ink has entered - normally using a tattoo needle - the pigment begins to\n        disperse itself through the epidermis and the upper dermis. Once it has entered these layers of the skin, the\n        body sends out some of its billions of personal protection operatives for foreign agents – <b>Phagocytes</b>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The main function of <b>Phagocytes</b> within the human body is to protect from harmful particles, and are\n        essential for shielding the human body from infections and providing subsequent immunity. They are attracted to\n        foreign particles by chemical signals released by bacteria or other <b>Phagocytes</b>, and when eventually\n        coming into contact with their target, they bind, and then engulf them. Here-in lies the problem; the ink\n        particles are too big to be ingested by the Phagocytes, so instead are held in stasis in the layers of skin by\n        its <b>collagen</b> network (the skins main structural protein).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So now you may be beginning to get an inkling as to how tattoos can be removed. The aforementioned{' '}\n        <b>Q-switched lasers</b> emit a centralised burst of light, targeting a specific spectrum of colour represented\n        in the tattoo. This means that for tattoos with differing colours, multiple lasers must be used. The laser is\n        fired at these pigments, and as it hits, in nanoseconds they are heated up by thousands of degrees, eventually\n        emitting the contained energy as a shockwave, in a process known as <b>Photothermolysis</b>. The shockwave\n        ripples through the dermis of the skin, causing weaker structures to break apart – such as the ink particles -\n        while larger, stronger ones, merely vibrate. Once the tattoo pigment has been broken up into smaller fragments,\n        the Phagocytes can then fully engulf and dispose of them. The whole process can take 6-8 sessions of laser\n        removal for a normal sized tattoo, and up to 10 sessions for larger tattoos.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So, given the fact that over 1 in 4 individuals are reported as regretting ever getting a tattoo, there’s hope\n        on the horizon with this amazing technology. So your mate Dave with his ‘<i>NO RAGRETS</i>’ motif across his\n        chest can still have some optimism.\n      </p>\n    </SubjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default TattooRemoval;\n","\n/* **********************************************\n     Begin prism-core.js\n********************************************** */\n\n/// <reference lib=\"WebWorker\"/>\n\nvar _self = (typeof window !== 'undefined')\n\t? window   // if in browser\n\t: (\n\t\t(typeof WorkerGlobalScope !== 'undefined' && self instanceof WorkerGlobalScope)\n\t\t? self // if in worker\n\t\t: {}   // if in node js\n\t);\n\n/**\n * Prism: Lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting\n *\n * @license MIT <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>\n * @author Lea Verou <https://lea.verou.me>\n * @namespace\n * @public\n */\nvar Prism = (function (_self){\n\n// Private helper vars\nvar lang = /\\blang(?:uage)?-([\\w-]+)\\b/i;\nvar uniqueId = 0;\n\n\nvar _ = {\n\t/**\n\t * By default, Prism will attempt to highlight all code elements (by calling {@link Prism.highlightAll}) on the\n\t * current page after the page finished loading.

For example, the CSS language definition\n\t\t * not only defines CSS highlighting for CSS documents, but also needs to define highlighting for CSS embedded\n\t\t * in HTML through `<style>` elements. To do this, it needs to modify `Prism.languages.markup` and add the\n\t\t * appropriate tokens. However, `Prism.languages.markup` is a regular JavaScript object literal, so if you do\n\t\t * this:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.markup.style = {\n\t\t *     // token\n\t\t * };\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * then the `style` token will be added (and processed) at the end. `insertBefore` allows you to insert tokens\n\t\t * before existing tokens. For the CSS example above, you would use it like this:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'cdata', {\n\t\t *     'style': {\n\t\t *         // token\n\t\t *     }\n\t\t * });\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ## Special cases\n\t\t *\n\t\t * If the grammars of `inside` and `insert` have tokens with the same name, the tokens in `inside`'s grammar\n\t\t * will be ignored.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * This behavior can be used to insert tokens after `before`:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', {\n\t\t *     'comment': Prism.languages.markup.comment,\n\t\t *     // tokens after 'comment'\n\t\t * });\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ## Limitations\n\t\t *\n\t\t * The main problem `insertBefore` has to solve is iteration order. Since ES2015, the iteration order for object\n\t\t * properties is guaranteed to be the insertion order (except for integer keys) but some browsers behave\n\t\t * differently when keys are deleted and re-inserted. So `insertBefore` can't be implemented by temporarily\n\t\t * deleting properties which is necessary to insert at arbitrary positions.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * To solve this problem, `insertBefore` doesn't actually insert the given tokens into the target object.\n\t\t * Instead, it will create a new object and replace all references to the target object with the new one. This\n\t\t * can be done without temporarily deleting properties, so the iteration order is well-defined.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * However, only references that can be reached from `Prism.languages` or `insert` will be replaced. I.e. if\n\t\t * you hold the target object in a variable, then the value of the variable will not change.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * ```js\n\t\t * var oldMarkup = Prism.languages.markup;\n\t\t * var newMarkup = Prism.languages.insertBefore('markup', 'comment', { ... });\n\t\t *\n\t\t * assert(oldMarkup !== Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t * assert(newMarkup === Prism.languages.markup);\n\t\t * ```\n\t\t *\n\t\t * @param {string} inside The property of `root` (e.g. a language id in `Prism.languages`) that contains the\n\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t * @param {string} before The key to insert before.\n\t\t * @param {Grammar} insert An object containing the key-value pairs to be inserted.\n\t\t * @param {Object<string, any>} [root] The object containing `inside`, i.e. the object that contains the\n\t\t * object to be modified.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Defaults to `Prism.languages`.\n\t\t * @returns {Grammar} The new grammar object.\n\t\t * @public\n\t\t */\n\t\tinsertBefore: function (inside, before, insert, root) {\n\t\t\troot = root || /** @type {any} */ (_.languages);\n\t\t\tvar grammar = root[inside];\n\t\t\t/** @type {Grammar} */\n\t\t\tvar ret = {};\n\n\t\t\tfor (var token in grammar) {\n\t\t\t\tif (grammar.hasOwnProperty(token)) {\n\n\t\t\t\t\tif (token == before) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (var newToken in insert) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (insert.hasOwnProperty(newToken)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tret[newToken] = insert[newToken];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Do not insert token which also occur in insert.

How come they\n        don’t seem to shrink when it rains? Why do they appear angelically white? All great questions, so let’s break it\n        down.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Clouds primarily consist of water droplets and ice crystals, small and light enough to float in the air; but how\n        did the water vapour get up there in the first place?\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        When water particles are heated to a sufficient degree, they transform into a gas known as water vapour through\n        the course of evaporation. During this transformation, the water vapour is able to absorb heat particles from\n        their source, cooling the original source down in the process. However, there’s an issue. Air can only hold a\n        specific amount of water vapour at any given time, dependant on its temperature and weight – known as\n        atmospheric pressure, and given higher temperatures and atmospheric pressure, a greater quantity can be\n        maintained. However, once it reaches its maximum threshold – known as the dew point - if a drop in temperature\n        or atmospheric pressure occurs, the only option is for this water vapour to convert from gas to liquid, via the\n        process of condensation.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The newly condensed water particles can cling onto the billions of tiny particles that are travelling in the air\n        at any given time – usually a piece of pollen or dust, collecting at a central point known as the condensation\n        nuclei. These small masses have a radius between a few microns (thousandths of a millimetre) to a few tens of\n        microns. When billions of these particles collect together they form a cloud. As these particles are so\n        minuscule, they are lightweight enough to not have any appreciable fall velocity, meaning they remain floating\n        in the air.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        This however, still doesn’t explain how rain-showers occur. As the water droplets in a cloud collide whilst\n        moving in the air, they start to gain greater mass up to a tipping point where they are no longer able to freely\n        float in the air and gravity begins to take control. If these droplets are sufficiently large enough when\n        leaving the cloud (0.1 millimetres in diameter) they can survive the fall to earth without evaporating in the\n        process. Yet, this only results in what we recognise commonly as drizzle in Europe.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Surprisingly, temperatures at cloud level are usually below 0ºC, yet the water droplets can remain in liquid\n        form by a process known as super cooling. This is because water can exist as liquid if there are no nucleation\n        centres – points for it to condense at. However, small collisions or the presence of a suitable ice nuclei can\n        cause the water droplets to freeze solid. Water vapour can more easily condense onto these frozen particles,\n        allowing them to grow faster than their surrounding compatriots and in turn fall sooner. As they fall through\n        warmer layers of the air they begin to melt, and eventually reach the ground as heavy rain. Amazingly, if these\n        particles form in a sufficiently thick cloud they can reach the ground before melting, leading to what we refer\n        to as hail or sleet.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Now onto the final question, why do they appear white? The primary reason is that light transmitted from the sun\n        is white. To expand further, visible light travels as a wave (part of the electromagnetic spectrum); which when\n        spread out – such as a rainbow - allows us to perceive every viewable colour (disregarding black as that occurs\n        through the absence of colour). Each of these visible colours has a different wavelength (e.g. blue has the\n        shortest wavelength at around 400 nanometres, whilst red is the longest at 700 nanometres). Smaller particles\n        are able to scatter shorter wavelengths present in the atmosphere around 16 times more efficiently than longer\n        ones – making the sky appear blue, whilst larger particles such as water droplets scatter all wavelengths\n        relatively equally meaning no colour predominates – this is known as Mie Scattering. This means that to the\n        human eye, clouds appear white.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        This may raise one final question. So why do some clouds (normally before it rains) appear grey? When light\n        initially hits the water droplets gathered in a cloud, the light particles reflect back towards the sun or\n        scatter to the sides of the cloud, making the base (the perceivable side from the ground) of the cloud appear\n        grey. This is accentuated in rain clouds, where the condensation nuclei are larger, meaning less light from the\n        sun reaches the bottom of a cloud. This explains why if you’ve been on a flight, as the plane reaches its\n        maximum altitude all the clouds below appear to be pearly white.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        So next time you’re on the way to work on a rainy day, you can give the scientific explanation to your boss as\n        to why you’re soaked through.\n      </p>\n    </SubjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CloudFormation;\n","import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react';\nimport content from './InfiniteMadness.data';\nimport SubjectPage from '../../../components/subject-page/SubjectPage';\n\nconst InfiniteMadness: FunctionComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <SubjectPage post={content}>\n      <div />\n    </SubjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default InfiniteMadness;\n","import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react';\nimport SubjectPage from '../../../components/subject-page/SubjectPage';\nimport content from './GoogleSearch.data';\n\nconst GoogleSearch: FunctionComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <SubjectPage post={content}>\n      <p></p>\n    </SubjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default GoogleSearch;\n","import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react';\nimport content from './TypeScript3.7.data';\nimport SubjectPage from '../../../components/subject-page/SubjectPage';\nimport 'prismjs/components/prism-javascript.min';\n\nconst TypeScript37: FunctionComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <SubjectPage post={content} sidebarPresent={false}>\n      <h2>Optional Chaining</h2>\n      <h4>\n        <code className=\"language-javascript\">?.</code> Operator\n      </h4>\n\n      <p>\n        Optional Chaining is a great new feature which allows expressions to only run until the point one of the\n        accessed fields is equal to <code className=\"language-javascript\">null</code> or{' '}\n        <code className=\"language-javascript\">undefined</code>.

If we travel back to Medieval England we get a greater\n        understanding as to its origins. Common law dictated at the time that the price of bread was related to the cost\n        of the wheat used in its production. Any baker found to be selling overpriced loaves was subject to punishment,\n        including large fines and flogging. Thus, to account for anomalies in the baking process, bakers would bake an\n        extra loaf to ensure they were free from prosecution.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Shambles</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        A shambles nowadays commonly references a situation or state of total disorder, and its origins are similarly\n        grimy. Butchers in the 16-17th century would display and sell their goods on a table or stall in the street,\n        which was known as a <b>shamble</b>. This led to the collective noun representing the street where butchers\n        operated being known as the <b>shambles</b> (this street name survives in many towns to this day). However, as\n        butchers would throw offal into the streets where they worked, the meaning began to be associated with being a\n        place of\n        <b>untidiness or disorganisation</b>.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Humble Pie</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        In the 14th century the <b>numbles</b> was the name given to the less appetizing parts (heart, liver, entrails,\n        etc. – what we now know as offal) of an animal – and by the 15th century this had migrated to <b>umbles</b>. The{' '}\n        <b>umbles</b> were commonly used as a primary ingredient in pies given their relatively low cost at the time, so\n        were often eaten by the lower classes, whilst the upper classes would take the more valued cuts. The adjective{' '}\n        <b>humble</b> was derived separately, meaning of lower class or low estimation of one’s importance. The\n        similarity in the two words likely led to its current idiomatic meaning –{' '}\n        <b>make a humble apology and accept humiliation</b>.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Goodbye</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        This is relatively simple one, but interesting nonetheless. In the 15th century a common farewell was ‘\n        <b>God be with thee</b>’. Over 300 years this eventually got compounded; ‘<b>God be with yee</b>’ in the 16th\n        century; ‘<b>God b&apos;wee</b>’ in the 17th century; and eventually ‘<b>Goodbye</b>’ in the late 17th century.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Beyond the Pale</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        What we know today as pale (light in colour) is far different from its now obsolete early English meaning – a\n        stake or pointed piece of wood, also known as a fencepost. In turn the <b>Pale</b> began to be associated with\n        the area enclosed by these pale posts, such as a settlement. Therefore, anyone wanting to go outside of these\n        safe areas were said to be going ‘<b>beyond the Pale</b>’ – to go outside agreed standard of decency.\n      </p>\n\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        If you liked this article, you can read the next part{' '}\n        <SubjectPageTextLink linkText={'here'} link={'/origin-of-sayings-part-two'} history={history} />.\n      </p>\n    </SubjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default withRouter(OriginOfSayingsPt1);\n","import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react';\nimport SubjectPage from '../../../../components/subject-page/SubjectPage';\nimport content from './OriginOfSayings.pt2.data';\nimport SubjectPageTextLink from '../../../../components/subject-page/SubjectPageTextLink';\nimport { RouteComponentProps, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst OriginOfSayingsPt2: FunctionComponent<RouteComponentProps> = ({ history }) => {\n  return (\n    <SubjectPage post={content} sidebarPresent={false}>\n      <p>The English language is full of nuanced sayings that are used everyday, whilst being rooted in history.</p>\n\n      <h3>Nail Your Colours to the Mast</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        During nautical battles, the flag of a ship were struck (lowered) to surrender to the enemy – and was customary\n        for the enemy to direct the cannon towards the ships mast during a battle to disable it. If all of the masts\n        were hit, the captain usually had little choice but to <b>lay down arms</b>. However, if the captain decided to\n        fight on, the crew were ordered to hoist the colours on remnants of the ships rigging, said to be ‘\n        <b>nailing the colours to the mast</b>’.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The expression is widely believed to have originated from the crew of the <b>Venerable</b>, the flagship of\n        British Admiral Adam Duncan, at the <b>Battle of Camperdown</b>, in 1797. The mainmast of the ship was struck by\n        the Dutch enemy and the ships flag was brought down by the blast of the cannon, which could be interpreted by\n        the rest of the fleet as surrender. However, Jack Crawford, a sea-hand upon the ship, climbed the remains of the\n        splintered mast and nailed the standard back in place. With its standard intact, the fleet continued and the\n        British were eventually victorious, with the battle penned to be the ending of the Dutch dominance at sea and\n        the beginning of ‘Britannia ruling the waves’.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Hair of the Dog</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        Anyone who’s woken up after a heavy night of drinking has probably heard this one. But its original etymology\n        can be traced back as far as 2500BC in Northern Syria, from a book in which the God Ilu becomes hungover after a\n        drinking binge, and the recipe in which he is prescribed consists or ‘<b>hairs of a dog</b>’ and an unknown\n        plant mixed with olive oil. The belief seems to stem from a belief that being bitten by a rabid dog could be\n        cured by ingesting a potion containing some of the dog’s fur. The phrase also exists in Hungarian, directly\n        translated as ‘you may cure the dog’s bite with its fur’.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Steal Someone&apos;s Thunder</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        Surprisingly, this idiom comes from a real event in the early 18th century. The petulant playwright and critic\n        John Dennis devised a thunder machine that could be used during one of his plays -consisting of a sheet of tin\n        being rattled backstage. Unfortunately, the play was a disaster and flopped - yet a few days later he found it\n        used at a performance of Macbeth upon which he had communicated his thunder machine to the managers. Upon the\n        discovery he is quoted as saying ‘\n        <b>that is my thunder by God; the villains will play my thunder, but not my plays</b>’.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Once in a Blue Moon</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        It is generally believe to mean something highly irregular or rare – originating from a clerical pamphlet\n        printed in 1528, where one of the characters converses to another, ‘Yf they say the mone is blewe/We must\n        believe that it is true’. It is likely in reference to the fact that priests at the time expected any statement\n        they made to their parish to be believed, no matter how farcical.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        However, a blue moon is in fact possible. This occurred most notably after the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883,\n        when the moon had a blue tinge for almost two years. This is due to the large ash particles in the atmosphere\n        that were released after the eruption, diffract red light making the moon appear blue or slightly green.\n        Particles of mixed sizes are far more common however, and these are more likely to diffract blue light, giving\n        the moon a red tinge, especially when the moon is on the horizon and more particles are likely to interfere with\n        the line of sight.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Give the Cold Shoulder</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        In everyday use, this often means to ignore or turn away from someone. Some etymologists believe it to have\n        originated from medieval etiquette. After hosting a feast, to hint that the meal was over and it was time for\n        the guests to leave, they would serve a cold slice of pork or beef shoulder. However, it is far more likely that\n        it came from a Latin mistranslation of the word ‘umerus’ (meaning both back and shoulder) from the works of Sir\n        Walter Scott – &ldquo;[her] dislike did na gang farther at first than just{' '}\n        <b>shewing o&apos; the cauld shouther...</b>&rdquo;.\n      </p>\n\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        If you liked this article, you can read the previous part{' '}\n        <SubjectPageTextLink linkText={'here'} link={'/origin-of-sayings-part-one'} history={history} />.\n      </p>\n    </SubjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default withRouter(OriginOfSayingsPt2);\n","import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react';\nimport content from './CPPPointers.data';\nimport SubjectPage from '../../../components/subject-page/SubjectPage';\nimport 'prismjs/components/prism-cmake.min';\nimport 'prismjs/components/prism-c.min';\nimport 'prismjs/components/prism-cpp.min';\n\nconst CPPPointers: FunctionComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <SubjectPage post={content} sidebarPresent={false}>\n      <h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        C and C++ unlike a lot of other languages provide the ability to directly interact with hardware memory -\n        normally described as a middle-level or &apos;systems&apos; language - through the use of\n        <b>pointers</b>.

Unlike an aeroplane, a helicopter does not need to\n        reach great speed to ascend (speed of the rotor actually provides no difference to the altitude of a\n        helicopter), instead lifting through a process known as the <b>Bernoulli Principle</b>. This principle outlines\n        how the speed and the pressure in air are inversely proportional; when pressure goes up, speed goes down, and\n        vice versa. Helicopter wings are designed specifically to exploit this knowledge – curved on top, and flat on\n        the bottom – allowing the helicopter to gain lift. As long as this lift force is greater than the weight of the\n        helicopter, the helicopter will begin to rise.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        However, a helicopter cannot only have a single rotor, as <b>Newton’s third law of motion</b> comes into play,\n        stating that any force on an object in a direction receives an equal acting force in the opposite direction.\n        This means that as a rotor spins whilst a helicopter is in flight, the entire body of the craft below slowly\n        spins in the opposite direction. This <b>torque</b> (turning force) would, understandably, make any helicopter\n        incredibly difficult to control if left unmanaged, so as a counteraction, a counter-torque is introduced. This\n        can take the shape of a second rotor spinning in the opposite direction as seen in a behemoth Chinook, or on\n        more common helicopters, a <b>tail rotor</b>.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We now have a stationary spinning container – not much use to anyone. So how do we begin to move in a specific\n        direction? This is through the control of the <b>collective</b> and <b>cyclic</b> pitch. The{' '}\n        <b>collective pitch</b> decreases or increases the angle at which all the rotor blades are travelling, whilst\n        the <b>cyclic pitch</b> is used to change the pitch angle or tilt of the blades, ensuring the blades pass\n        through the same point in the cycle. This is all controlled through a pivotal part of the helicopter controls –\n        the <b>swash plate</b> - each blade connected through short vertical rods called <b>pitch links</b>.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        A phenomenon comes in to play when helicopters want to move in a direction – <b>gyroscopic procession</b>. This\n        occurs when a spinning object or gyroscope has a force applied to it, the maximum force is manifested{' '}\n        <b>90 degrees after</b>\n        (not exactly 90 in rotor blades due to external aerodynamic forces). This is accomplished in helicopter controls\n        by a component known as a <b>pitch horn</b>, which is offset by 90 degrees, ensuring that input to the cyclic\n        and collective controls occur 90 degrees prior when they should take effect. For further learning, a great video\n        on this topic can be viewed <a href={'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5bKzBZ7XuM'}>here</a>.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Amazingly, helicopters don’t even need power once up in the air to land safely, and instead can land use a\n        technique known as <b>autorotation</b>. Whereas in normal helicopter motion, air is drawn in from above and\n        exhausted downward, the mere action of air travelling through the rotor blades whilst a helicopter is falling,\n        at the correct collective pitch allows the rotor blades to spin at sufficient speed. As there is also almost no\n        torque produced during autorotation, the tail rotor isn’t necessary either. The longest autorotation in history\n        was performed by Jean Boulet in 1972 after he reached an altitude of <b>12,440m</b>, where, due to a large\n        temperature drop, the engine flamed out and could not be restarted.\n      </p>\n    </SubjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default HelicopterFlight;\n","import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react';\nimport content from './Caffeine.data';\nimport SubjectPage from '../../../components/subject-page/SubjectPage';\n\nconst Caffeine: FunctionComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <SubjectPage post={content}>\n      <p></p>\n    </SubjectPage>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Caffeine;\n","import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react';\nimport content from './GitFunctionality.data';\nimport SubjectPage from '../../../components/subject-page/SubjectPage';\nimport 'prismjs/components/prism-git.min';\n\nconst GitFunctionality: FunctionComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <SubjectPage post={content} sidebarPresent={false}>\n      <h2>Introduction</h2>\n      <p>\n        Git as a version control system has usage across the world. But many developers still limit themselves, staying\n        within mainstay commands. This article will investigate these litany of commands, and hopefully increase your\n        understanding and productivity.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Merge</h3>\n      <p>\n        For example, take a common development team example. A team member has created a branch from <i>master</i>, and\n        added new functionality to print their name when the application runs. While the developer has been doing this,\n        the master branch has been advanced with 5 more features, leaving the new feature branch out-of-sync. A common\n        practice is to therefore run <b>git merge</b>, creating a new single commit in the feature branch, which\n        collects all of the commits made since the feature branch was diverged from master.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This does have its pitfalls though. Given a large team where changes are consistently being pushed to the{' '}\n        <b>master</b> branch, the feature branch will have a high number of merge commits polluting its history. This\n        can be filtered away with an advanced git log, but without it, it may be confusing for other developers looking\n        at your code to quickly understand where changes were made.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Rebase</h3>\n      <p>\n        Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Similar to merge,{' '}\n        <i>rebase</i> can used to integrate changes from one branch, into another. However, unlike merge (which is a\n        non-destructive operation), rebase is used to move the entire feature branch, to the tip of the master branch,\n        incorporating all of the previous commits from the master branch. This removes the need for the unnecessary\n        commits from a merge, leaving a linear project history.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Squashing Commits</h3>\n      <p>\n        There are times when you realise after you&apos;ve committed a new feature, you still need to make some changes.\n        Commonly, a developer will make the change, and commit it to the branch, like so:\n      </p>\n      <pre>\n        <code className={'language-git'}>\n          {`$ git log\ncommit d84b3e1f899d48c49e8f513302293ff36d1b0421 (HEAD -> master)\nAuthor: Christopher Philp <email>\nDate:   Wed Dec 16 14:46:45 2020 +0000\n\n    [master] | Removing unused line\n\ncommit 6a4e34b35dd3d5cd6e3fe34df9e04b3f80be0b85\nAuthor: Christopher Philp <email>\nDate:   Wed Dec 16 14:46:06 2020 +0000\n\n    [master] | Furthering altering Git instruction\n\ncommit bd0a16d1ffbaba26aa2a3e3715eba19503b4c190\nAuthor: Christopher Philp <email>\nDate:   Wed Dec 16 14:45:46 2020 +0000\n\n    [master] | Altering Git instruction\n\ncommit 0db3d898d87770b47a85c56c61a46bc46343e30a\nAuthor: Christopher Philp <email>\nDate:   Wed Dec 16 14:38:59 2020 +0000\n\n    [master] | Adding initial Git article\n`}\n        </code>\n      </pre>\n      <p>\n        This has needlessly increased the size of the git history, with lots of commits that add nothing.
