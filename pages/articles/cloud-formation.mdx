# Every Cloud Has a Silver... What?

## The Formation of Clouds

Ever wondered how these wondrous 500,000 tonne masses form and travel across the skyline each day? How come they
don’t seem to shrink when it rains? Why do they appear angelically white? All great questions, so let’s break it
down.

Clouds primarily consist of water droplets and ice crystals, small and light enough to float in the air; but how
did the water vapour get up there in the first place?

When water particles are heated to a sufficient degree, they transform into a gas known as water vapour through
the course of evaporation. During this transformation, the water vapour is able to absorb heat particles from
their source, cooling the original source down in the process. However, there’s an issue. Air can only hold a
specific amount of water vapour at any given time, dependant on its temperature and weight – known as
atmospheric pressure, and given higher temperatures and atmospheric pressure, a greater quantity can be
maintained. However, once it reaches its maximum threshold – known as the dew point - if a drop in temperature
or atmospheric pressure occurs, the only option is for this water vapour to convert from gas to liquid, via the
process of condensation.
