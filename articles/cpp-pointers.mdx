## Introduction

C and C++ unlike a lot of other languages provide the ability to directly interact with hardware memory -
normally described as a middle-level or &apos;systems&apos; language - through the use of
<b>pointers</b>. Every variable declared in any language has a memory location, and every memory location has an
address used to locate it - C++ gives you the power to directly modify this memory.

### Accessing Memory

In C++, the <b>memory address</b> (where a value lives) of a variable can be accessed through the{' '}
<code className={'language-cpp'}>&</code> operator - see the example below.

```cpp
std::string food = "Pizza";
cout << food;  // Outputs the value of food (Pizza)
cout << &food; // Outputs the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)
```

### Pointers

A pointer on the other hand, is a variable that *stores the memory address of a variable as its value*, and
is created using the `*` operator. A pointer can exist for *any data type*, as it merely points to a memory address of the variable.

```cpp
int x = 5;
int* y = &x;
// Equivalent to
int *y = &x;

cout << x;  // Outputs the value of x (5)
cout << y; // Outputs the memory address of x (0x6dfed4)
cout << &y; // Outputs the memory address of y (0x6ffd4)
cout << *y; // Outputs the value of x (5)
```

### Arrow Operator <code className={'language-cpp'}>-&gt;</code>

The arrow operator is a <b>shorthand method for accessing the contents of a</b>{' '}
<code className={'language-cpp'}>struct</code> <b>or</b> <code className={'language-cpp'}>class</code>{' '}
<b>pointer</b> - normally the <code className={'language-cpp'}>.</code> operator would be used for non-pointer
access. The example below shows the equivalences.

```cpp
class Rectangle {
  int width, height;
  public:
  void set_values (int,int);
  int area (void);
} rect;

Rectangle* p_rect = &rect; // Creates a pointer to the rect declared above
p_rect->area;
// This is equivalent to
(*p_rect).area;
```

### References and Pointers

By default, arguments to a function in C++ are passed by value, and the changes made to any arguments inside the
function will not affect the original value, and instead are made to a copy. The 3 main ways - including pass by
value - to pass arguments to a function are shown below.

#### Call by <b>value</b>:

```cpp
int square1(int n)
{
  cout << &n; // Outputs the memory address of n (0x6dfed4)
  n *= n;
  // Original n is unchanged - a copy of n has been created,
  // only the n inside the function is altered
  return n;
}
```

#### Call by *reference with a pointer argument*:

```cpp
int x = 5;
int *p_x = &x;
square(p_x);

void square(int *n)
{
  cout << n; // Outputs the memory address of n, which is the same as x (0x6dfed4)
  *n *= *n; // Deferences to get the value at the memory address of p_x,
  // updating the value stored there
  cout << *n; // Outputs the squared value of x (25)
  cout << x; // Outputs the altered value of x (25)
}
```

#### Call by *reference with reference argument*:

```cpp
int x = 5;
square(x);

void square(int &n)
{
  // Inside the function, the reference is used to access the
  // actual argument used in the call
  cout << &n; // Outputs the memory address of x (0x6dfed4)
  cout << n; // Outputs the value of x (5)

  // Implicit de-referencing (without '*')
  n *= n;
  cout << n; // Outputs the altered value of n, which is equal to x (25)
  cout << nx; // Outputs the altered value of x (25)
}
```

### Benefits of Pointers

There are a number of benefits to using pointers:
- Values that are passed in to a function <b>do not have to be copied</b>, especially useful with large objects.
- They allow <b>more than one value to be returned from a function</b>.
- Memory access through pointers is stated to be *more efficient than through an array*.

```cpp
int x = 5;
int y = 55;
int *p_x, *p_y = &x;
edit_two(*x, *y);

void edit_two(int *x, int *y)
{
  *x += 5;
  *y += 5;

  cout << *x; // Edit's the value at the memory address of x (10)
  cout << y*; // Edit's the value at the memory address of x (60)
}
```

Hopefully this has cleared up any confusion surrounding pointers and you can begin to understand those
insufferable `nullptr` exceptions.
