**Lasers**. Not the type that you saw in those classic James Bond movies, slowly advancing
to the hero's groin. These are known as *Q-switched lasers* and are the most common way to remove
tattoos. Before getting to the removal stage however, it is important to understand how tattoos
remain in the body.

Tattooing involves inserting ink into the dermal tissue layer of the skin (found under the epidermis – the
outermost layer of the skin). Once the ink has entered - normally using a tattoo needle - the pigment begins to
disperse itself through the epidermis and the upper dermis. Once it has entered these layers of the skin, the
body sends out some of its billions of personal protection operatives for foreign agents – Brex... no, *Phagocytes*.

The main function of *Phagocytes* within the human body is to protect from harmful particles, and are
essential for shielding the human body from infections and providing subsequent immunity. They are attracted to
foreign particles by chemical signals released by bacteria or other *Phagocytes*, and when eventually
coming into contact with their target, they bind, and then engulf them. Herein lies the problem; the ink
particles are too big to be ingested by the Phagocytes, so instead are held in stasis in the layers of skin by
its *collagen* network (the skins main structural protein).

So now you may be beginning to get an inkling as to how tattoos can be removed. The aforementioned
*Q-switched lasers* emit a centralised burst of light, targeting a specific spectrum of colour represented
in the tattoo. This means that for tattoos with differing colours, multiple lasers must be used (looking at you Ed Sheeran).
The laser is fired at these pigments, and as it hits, they are heated up by thousands of degrees, eventually
emitting the contained energy as a shockwave in a process known as *Photothermolysis*. The shockwave
ripples through the dermis of the skin, causing weaker structures to break apart – such as the ink particles -
while larger, stronger ones, merely vibrate. Once the tattoo pigment has been broken up into small enough fragments,
the Phagocytes can then fully engulf and dispose of them. The whole process can take 6-8 sessions of laser
removal for a normal-sized tattoo, and up to 10 sessions for larger tattoos.

So, given the fact that over 1 in 4 individuals are reported as regretting ever getting a tattoo, there’s hope
on the horizon for your mate Dave with his ‘*NO RAGRETS*’ motif across his chest can still have some optimism.
