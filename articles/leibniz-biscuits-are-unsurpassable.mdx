There are many opinions I claim that you may find questionable. Exaggerated. Subjective.

This is not one of them.

Leibniz chocolate biscuits are unsurpassable. Bahlsen has created, within a 2x1 inch area, a perfect biscuit.

I do not mean best in the way people come to mean when they say a restaurant is the best because it gave them a free
limoncello and the waiter sang Happy Birthday to their half-deaf grandmother. I mean best in the sense that, if you were
forced to explain to an alien what a biscuit is meant to do, you could hand it a Leibniz and say -> this.

It balances the firm backbone of a luscious butter biscuit against the soft luxuriousness of mouth-watering milk
chocolate. Rich, but not cloying. Indulgent, but not heavy.

But the real test, the courtroom cross-examination where weak biscuits fold, is tea.

Your common bourbon will crumble to dust with its first dunk, your digestive splits like the Titanic,
and don't even mention the disgusting mush you encounter with a custard cream. The Leibniz stands proud whilst subtly
flavouring your tea during the process.

Yes, you may gain a kilo per box. Yes, you may regret ever discovering their existence. And yes, your face may begin
to closely resemble a minefield. But by God, what is life if it does not contain some small pleasures. And what a treat
to give in to.
