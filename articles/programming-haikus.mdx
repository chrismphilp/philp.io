A tiny bug lands,

He multiplies in silence,

Red builds, anger follows.

---

Code reviews calm me,

Read, review, merge, review, read,

Me calm reviews code.

---

Make it readable,

Lock it down with tighter tests,

Then argue styling.

---

Craft prompts carefully,

For hallucination comes,

And endless sorries.

---

Code can be cleaner,

A test can be more stringent,

Though tabs are evil.
