I've been reading quite a bit of climate literature recently, and it got me thinking of what my impact is in the 
world. This will probably be a multiple part series, but as a starter for ten I wondered how climate friendly is this
blog. And if it's not, how could it be improved.

To start with it's worth investigating the current state. 

### Current State

An evaluation on [websitecarbon](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/philp-io) shows that we're pretty good, only 0.06g of carbon produced
on a site visit, but we can probably do better.

[Going through some of the suggestions](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/website-energy-efficiency/) there was some pretty quick wins in
terms of increasing efficiency and reducing the footprint.

### Reducing Image Size

Currently images are generated in a variety of different sizes to aid slower browsers. However they are slightly over-eager currently.

```tsx
  images: {
    loader: 'custom',
    imageSizes: [16, 64, 128, 256, 384],
    deviceSizes: [320, 640, 1080, 1920, 2048],
  },
```

Cutting this back reduces the eventual generated images by nearly half. Big success.

```tsx
  images: {
    loader: 'custom',
    imageSizes: [16, 64, 128, 256],
    deviceSizes: [320, 1080, 1920],
  },
```

### Progressive Web Apps (PWA)

PWAs allow web applications to be directly installed onto a users device, offering the ability to work while a users device is offline.
Alongside this they are also able to update content in the background, and display notifications utilising the OS notification system. 

I'll probably have a separate article devoted to PWAs in the future, but for the moment the main point I'll be focussing on is the caching 
support. This reduces the number of calls being made for images, and improving the performance for the user. 

A barebones PWAs implementation for Next is pretty simple using `next-pwa`.

Updating from the existing:

```js
const mdx = withMDX(mdxConfig);

module.exports = {
  ...mdx,
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    version,
  }
}
```

to

```js
// Merge MDX config with Next.js config
const mdx = withMDX(mdxConfig);

const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public'
});

module.exports = {
  ...withPWA(mdx),
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    version,
  }
}
```

#### Unbreaking Dev

Due to the way PWAs are constructed, a dev environment isn't really suited to cached requests and service workers, with this warning appearing consistently:

```
WARNING in InjectManifest has been called multiple times, perhaps due to running webpack in --watch mode
```

With some minor changes to `next.config.js` I was able to ensure PWA support was disabled locally.

```js
const prod = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';

const withPWA = require('next-pwa')({
  dest: 'public',
  disable: !prod,
});
```

### Making Efficient Crawlers

Web crawlers can be a bit of a drag on a website, so giving them instructions on the optimal way to crawl a website can help to reduce the number of requests
being made.

The initial starting point was to stop crawlers operating on my quotes page. Who needs more inspiring one-liners thrown into the abyss?

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /quotes
```

However, adding a sitemap (a file containing the relationship between a websites pages) alongside this seemed pretty useful, and doing this manually was going
to be relatively painful each time a new post was added.

Time to turn to another library - [next-sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap).

This is a next integration which enables the generation of **sitemaps** and **robots.txt** as a build-step.

Setting it up was relatively simple:
```diff
  "scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.tsx\"",
    "dev": "next dev",
    "patch": "npm version --no-commit-hooks --no-git-tag-version patch && git add package.json package-lock.json && git commit -m \"[main] | Bumping version\"",
    "build": "next build",
+    "postbuild": "next-sitemap",
    "start": "npx serve@latest out",
    "static": "next build && next-image-export-optimizer",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
```


### Offline Fallback

Adding offline support with `next-pwa` is relatively trivial, and aids in reducing the number of requests. All it takes is adding a page under 
`_fallback.tsx`. Pretty trivial currently but give it a spin if you feel like it.

```tsx
const Fallback = () => (
    <h1>This is an offline fallback page.</h1>
);

export default Fallback;
```

Although admittedly this does little in terms of reducing requests to a website, it's a pretty snazzy feature.

### Conclusion

The carbon footprint of the site has [been slighly reduced](https://ecograder.com) through these steps, although this was already shaving a pretty thin coat.

The image below gives an overview of the image heaviest page present on the site, with the main negative on the UX side coming from the number
of DOM elements generated by the `remark` and `rehype` plugins I have working on the formatted **MDX**.

I'll probably come back to this at a future date - potentially stripping out all the JS from this site - I'm just enjoying playing around too much
currently.
