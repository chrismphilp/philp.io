Learning Rust has been a personal project of mine but coming from Java the concept of ownership was alien.
To solidify this knowledge and also help others for future reference I'm going to summarise in ~5 minutes
what I've learnt.

## Ownership

Each variable in Rust has an owner. Once ownership is declared, there is exactly one binding to any given resource.

Once ownership is moved, the previous owner no longer has access.

```rust
let x = vec![1];
let y = x;

println!("{}", x[0])

//: # (error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `x`)
```

### Copies

Ownership rules do not apply to **primitive** types, or anything that implements the `Copy{:rust}` trait (which gives
a type **copy semantics** instead of **move semantics**).

```rust
let a = 5 as i32;
let _y = a as i64;

println!("{}", a);

//: Finished [] target(s) in 0.65s
```

### Functions

A function can also take ownership of a variable via its parameters, w.

```rust
fn new_owner(_x: Vec<i32>) {
  // my_vec is now owned by the new_owner function
}

let my_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1]; // vector containing a single element, 1
new_owner(my_vec);

print!("{}", my_vec[0]);
// error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `my_vec`
```

## Borrowing

Instead of taking ownership, a resource can be borrowed. Rather than passing by value, we can pass by reference.
The reference borrows ownership of the variable, until the period where it is released again, at
which point the prior owner can manipulate the data.

```rust
fn new_owner(_x: &Vec<i32>) {
  // my_vec is now borrowed by the new_owner function
  print!("{}", _x[0]);
}

let my_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1]; // vector containing a single element, 1
new_owner(&my_vec);

print!("{}", my_vec[0]);
// Compiles and prints: 11
```

The references are immutable, so changes to internal state are forbidden.

```rust
fn new_owner(_x: &Vec<i32>) {
  _x.insert(0, 1);
}
// error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*_x` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
```

### Mutable References

A mutable reference allows the mutation of borrowed resources.
