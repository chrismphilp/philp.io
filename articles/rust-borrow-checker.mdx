Coming from Java the concept of ownership was alien - so to solidify this knowledge I'm going to attempt a brief summary 
in ~5 minutes.

### Ownership

Each variable in Rust has an owner. Once ownership is declared, there is exactly one binding to any given resource[*](#reference-counting).

Once ownership is moved, the previous owner no longer has access.

```rust
let x = vec![1];
let y = x;

println!("{}", x[0])

//: # (error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `x`)
```

### Copies

Ownership rules do not apply to **primitive** types, or anything that implements the `Copy{:rust}` trait (which gives
a type **copy semantics** instead of **move semantics**).

```rust
let a = 5 as i32;
let _y = a as i64;

println!("{}", a);

//: Finished [] target(s) in 0.65s
```

### Functions

A function can also take ownership of a variable via its parameters.

```rust
fn new_owner(_x: Vec<i32>) {
  // my_vec is now owned by the new_owner function
}

let my_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1]; // vector containing a single element, 1
new_owner(my_vec);

print!("{}", my_vec[0]);
// error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `my_vec`
```

Whenever you see `f(value){:rust}` you can know that **f** has received ownership of **value**.

### Borrowing

Instead of taking ownership, a resource can be **borrowed**. Rather than passing by value, we can pass by reference.
The reference borrows ownership of the variable, until the period where it is released again, at
which point the prior owner can manipulate the data.

```rust
fn new_owner(_x: &Vec<i32>) {
  // my_vec is now borrowed by the new_owner function
  print!("{}", _x[0]);
}

let my_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1]; // vector containing a single element, 1
new_owner(&my_vec);

print!("{}", my_vec[0]);
// Compiles and prints: 11
```

The references are immutable, so changes to internal state are forbidden.

You can take a reference (pointer) to an item, but you have to give it back. In particular, you have to give it back 
before the lifetime of the underlying item expires, as tracked by the compiler.

```rust
fn new_owner(_x: &Vec<i32>) {
  _x.insert(0, 1);
}
// error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*_x` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
```

### Mutable References

A mutable reference allows the mutation of borrowed resources.

```rust /mut/
fn new_owner(_x: &mut Vec<i32>) {
  _x.insert(0, 5);
  print("{}", _x[0]);
}
 
let mut my_vec: Vec<i32> = vec![1]; // vector containing a single element, 1
new_owner(&mut my_vec);
// Compiles and prints: 5
```

#### Key Points

- If you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value.


```rust /mut/1-3
let mut s = String::from("Test");

let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{}, {}", r1, r2);
error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
```

- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference **or** any number of immutable references.

```rust /mut/5-6
let mut s = String::from("Test");

let r1 = &s;
let r2 = &mut s;

println!("{}, {}, and {}", r1, r2);
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
```

### Lifetimes

Borrowing references to objects and then passing them around can be dangerous. If a resource that has been borrowed
is deallocated by its owner we must ensure that other users can no longer access the value. In Rust this is done using 
lifetimes, which describe the scope of how long a particular reference is valid for.

Lifetimes are defined using the `'a` syntax, which means '*the lifetime a*'. 

```rust
fn hello_world<'a>(x: &'a i32) { ... }
```

The functions seen before have implicit lifetimes provided through a process known as *lifetime elision*.

```rust
fn print(s: &str); // elided (implicit)

fn print<'a>(s: &'a str); // expanded (explicit)
```

#### Structs

`struct{:rust}`s must define explicit lifetimes when containing a reference. This ensures that any reference to internal 
reference data within an object does not live longer than the owner.

```rust
struct Point {
  x: &'a i32,
  y: &'b i32,
}

fn main() {
  let tmp; 

  {
    let x: &i32 = &1;
    let y: &i32 = &2;
    let p1 = Point { x, y }; 
    tmp = &p1.x;
  } // p1 has exited its scope here
  
  println!("{}", tmp); // `p1.x` does not live long enough
}
```

### Smart Pointers

Smart pointer types act similarly to standard pointers, but allow further fine-grained control over behaviour.
When a developer uses memory that contains dynamically allocated data with smart pointers, they are automatically 
de-allocated.

#### Reference Cell

A reference cell is a smart pointer type that executes the borrowing rules at runtime rather than at compile time. 

`RefCell<T>{:rust}` has the following rules:
- If there is no reference to `T{:rust}`, you may get either a mutable or immutable reference.
- If there is already a mutable reference to `T{:rust}`, you must wait until this reference is dropped.
- If there are one or more immutable references to `T{:rust}`, you may get an immutable reference.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
let container = RefCell::new(11);

{
    let _c = container.borrow();
    // You may borrow immutably multiple times
    assert!(container.try_borrow().is_ok());
    // Cannot borrow as mutable because it is already borrowed as immutable.
    assert!(container.try_borrow_mut().is_err());
}
```

#### Reference Counting

Reference counts (`Rc<T>{:rust}`) sum up the number of references made to an object, and where no references exist, the data can be
de-allocated. A reference-counted pointer to an item allows shared ownership of the data, breaking one of the initial rules outlined
earlier, and allowing data leakage within Rust, so must be used with care. 

Graph data structures use `Rc<T>{:rust}`, as multiple edges might point to the same node, and that node is conceptually 
owned by all of the edges that point to it.

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

struct Node {
    next: RefCell<Option<Rc<Node>>>,
    val: i32
}

fn main() {
    let foo1 = Rc::new(Node { next: RefCell::new(None), val: 5 });
    let foo2 = Rc::new(Node { next: RefCell::new(Some(foo1.clone())), val: 10 });
    *foo1.next.borrow_mut() = Some(foo2.clone());
    // Node with value 10 <-> Node with value 5
}
```
