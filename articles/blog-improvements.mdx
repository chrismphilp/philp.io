## Starting Point

Don't laugh, the blog started out pretty rough.

Moving in to 2023 I felt that I'd reached my mid-blog-life crisis and a refresh was required.

### Migrating to NextJS

NextJS provides a number of advantages over vanilla React:
- Static site generation
- MDX support
- File based routing
- Image optimisation

### Converting to MDX

I've been using MDX for a couple of separate sites I've been building, - and it's made writing
technical prose a breeze. Previewing blog content within the IDE, with images, prior to switching to the browser
reduces time-to-production massively as well.

I decided to combine this with [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) enabling static processing of
MDX, with numerous plugins applied at compile time (discussed later). The docs themselves do declare:

> if you are trying to build a blog for personal or small business use, consider just using normal html and css.
> You definitely do not need to be using a heavy full-stack javascript framework to make a simple blog.

but where's the fun in being a conformist...


Also, the [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) scores speak for themselves, especially
for First Meaningful Paint times.

#### Article Metadata

Another benefit to `nest-mdx-remote` is the metadata being accessible from the markdown file itself, reducing the need
for manual intervention at compile times for display generation, and easy inclusion of article metadata in the HTML headers for SEO purposes.

Mine takes the format below:

```mdxjs {1-6}
---
title: Improving the Blog

---
```

Thanks to `mdx`, alongside these changes I added some flavour for the article summary cards including the [reading time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reading-time)
for each article (estimates based on markdown text-length), simple date sorting for recent article highlights utilising [DayJS](https://day.js.org/) from the date
metadata, and categories which will be used in future tag filtering.

### Tailwind

`styled-components` is a great library, but with some recent projects I've found it's a bit slower to prototype features,
with each element templated outside the primary render.

```tsx
// styled-component
const Button = styled.button`
    margin: 1rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
        padding: 2rem;
    }
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
    border: 2px solid blue;
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
`;

const TestComponent = () => <Button>Hello world!</Button>;
```

Tailwind allows you to quickly prototype inline styling and easily group styling across multiple components.
It's also pretty intuitive, so guessing commands becomes second nature (also has mature IDE auto-completion support).

```tsx
// tailwind
const TestComponent = () => (
    <div className="text-base mg-1 p-1 md:p-2 rounded border-solid border-2
                    border-light-blue-500 bg-blue-500 text-white-500">
        Hello World!
    </div>
);
```

As you can imagine this becomes unreadable when you start to get multiple elements in the tree.

### Plug-wins

I'm implementing both `rehype` and `remark` plugins as part of the site generation:

- `remark-gfm`: Support for advanced Markdown features such as tables and footnotes
- `rehype-slug`: Appends `id` attributes to each heading element
- `rehype-autolink-headings`: Utilises the `id` attribute above, generating direct page section links.
- `rehype-pretty-code`: Code highlighting using the `shiki` library. Not just syntax highlights but line numbers,
grouped highlights, css themes, and markdown metadata.
- `rehype-img-size`: Discussed [below](#image-lazy-loading).

This is all implemented with a config variable:
```tsx
const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
    ...,
    mdxOptions: {
      format: 'mdx',
      remarkPlugins: [
        remarkGfm,
      ],
      rehypePlugins: [
        rehypeSlug,
        [rehypeAutolinkHeadings, { behavior: 'wrap', properties: { className: ['anchor'] } }],
        [rehypePrettyCode, {
          theme: {
            dark: 'monokai',
            light: 'one-dark-pro',
          },
          keepBackground: true,
          onVisitHighlightedLine(node) {
            // Each line node by default has `class="line"`.
            node.properties.className?.push('highlighted');
          },
        }],
        [rehypeImgSize, { dir: 'public' }],
      ],
    },
  });
```

### Image Lazy Loading

As the website is statically generated, default lazy-loading for `next/image` elements is unsupported.

I've used the `next-image-export-optimizer` package to generate the images at build time, alongside the `rehype-img-size`
plugin. The plugin ensures that the image size can be extracted from the embedded markdown images, whilst the export provides images
in a number of sizes in the *WebP* format. This allows the image to be lazy-loaded by the browser, which can then be replaced
by the high-quality image for the correct page size once fully rendered.

```tsx
const mdxConfig = {
  ...,
  transpilePackages: ['react-icons', "next-image-export-optimizer"],
  images: {
    loader: "custom",
    imageSizes: [16, 64, 128, 256, 384],
    deviceSizes: [320, 640, 1080, 1920, 2048],
  },
  env: {
    nextImageExportOptimizer_imageFolderPath: "public",
    nextImageExportOptimizer_exportFolderPath: "out",
    nextImageExportOptimizer_quality: 75,
    nextImageExportOptimizer_storePicturesInWEBP: true,
    nextImageExportOptimizer_exportFolderName: "nextImageExportOptimizer",
    nextImageExportOptimizer_generateAndUseBlurImages: true,
  },
}
```

```tsx
const components = {
  img: (props) => <ExportedImage {...props} priority={true} placeholder='blur' loading='eager' role='img' />,
};

...
<MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
```

### Dark Mode

I thought this would be a relatively simple task, but it turned out to be more complicated than I'd anticipated.

The `next-themes` package provides a simple way to switch between light and dark mode, using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query,
and integrates nicely with `tailwind`.

```tsx {1-10}
import { useTheme } from 'next-themes';
import { useEffect,useState } from 'react';
import { RiMoonClearLine, RiSunLine } from 'react-icons/ri';

const ThemeToggle = () => {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
  const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme();

  // Show only when mounted on client, alleviating hydration issues
  useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);

  if (!mounted) return <></>;

  return (
    <HeaderIcon onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}>
      {theme === 'light' ? <RiMoonClearLine size={25} /> : <RiSunLine size={25} />}
    </HeaderIcon>
  );
};
```

However, due to the fact that each page is generated from `mdx`, switching the styling is slightly more complicated.

To get around this I added `scss` ensuring that when the `data-theme` is switched, the correct code blocks are
displayed.

```scss {1-12}
html.dark {
  pre[data-theme="light"],
  code[data-theme="light"] {
    display: none;
  }
}

html.light {
  pre[data-theme="dark"],
  code[data-theme="dark"] {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### Animation

To enter my final form:

![Even Further Beyond](/articles/images/dbz-goku.gif)

I decided to add some eye-candy with [framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/introduction/).

Using the component below I'm able to introduce all 5 readers (generous) of the blog to the near imperceptible movement of a hand.

```tsx
const HandWave = () => (
  <motion.div
    className='inline-block pl-1'
    animate={{ rotate: 20 }}
    transition={{
      from: 0,
      duration: 0.75,
      repeat: Infinity,
      repeatType: 'reverse',
      ease: 'easeInOut',
      type: 'tween',
    }}>
    ðŸ‘‹
  </motion.div>
);
```

N.B. to get a slightly more noticeable effect it's also been added to the theme switcher:

```tsx
<motion.div whileTap={{ rotate: 360 }}>
  <HeaderIcon onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}>
    {theme === 'light' ? <RiMoonClearLine size={25} /> : <RiSunLine size={25} />}
  </HeaderIcon>
</motion.div>
```

Give it a spin. Pardon the pun.
