## The Pursuit of Happiness

Imagine a devilish figure approached you in the night. Smiling, he exclaims:

"I can offer you eternal happiness with a snap of my fingers. No more anxiety, no restless late-nights, just a
never-ending blissful existence. My only request for this incredible gift is a transfer. I claim all of your prior
memories and experience, and you, in return, enter Nirvana".

You stand disconcerted, deliberating. Is this not what I've been working towards the whole of my adult life? Is this
not what every human strives for? Why did I suffer in meaningless jobs, torturous meetings, and endless study, if not
for this?

Finally, after careful consideration, you succumb and accept the offer.

"I'm glad. Return home, and sleep. Upon waking, you will find yourself in paradise".

You smile to yourself, thanking the divine for this stroke of luck and turn to begin the short walk home.

Suddenly a sharp pain flares at your nape, as the man whacks you across the head and you fall to the floor, gliding into unconsciousness.

5 hours later you awake in an almost comatose state, unaware of your surroundings but awash with a complete feeling of ecstasy.

### Why Truth Matters

Clearly this is a stretch, but it illustrates the point. Why would you accept a life that inherently holds no meaning,
even given the premise you would be unaware of its shortcomings. To me, objective truth is the separation here, and the
fundamental principle that most happiness originates from.

To discard truth is to remove your foundations and their relation to the world you operate within.
