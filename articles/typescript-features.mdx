## Optional Chaining

### ?. Operator

Optional Chaining is a great new feature which allows expressions to only run until the point one of the
accessed fields is equal to `null` or `undefined`. This is through the use of the `?.` operator - *optional property access* -
allowing anything expressed on the right of the question mark to continue executing, otherwise `undefined` is returned.

See the example below:

```js
let y = null;

// x === undefined
let x = y?.z.execute();

// Identical to the above
x = (y === null || y === undefined) ? undefined : y.z.execute();

y = {
  z: {
    execute: () => 5
  }
}
// x === 5
x = y?.z.execute();
```

Clearly the new optional chaining operator is is less verbose and more readable. Optional Chaining can also be
used in two further areas – *optional element access* and *optional calls*.

#### Optional Element Access

The optional chaining operator can be used when accessing to non-identifier properties. For instance if
accessing an index of an *array*:`

```js
// New operator usage
return arr?.[0];
// Previous approach
return (arr === null || arr === undefined) ? undefined : arr[0];
```

### Optional Calls

These allow us to conditionally call expressions if they’re not
`null` or `undefined`.

```js
let y = {
  z: {
    execute: undefined
  }
}

// x === undefined
let x = y.z?.execute?.();

y.z.execute = () => 5;

// x === 5
x = y.z?.execute?.();

y.z.execute = 5;

// This will still result in a type error
x = y.z?.execute?.();
```

### Nullish Coalescing

Nullish coalescing requires the use of the `??` operator and is used to fall back to a default value
when similarly dealing with `null` or `undefined`. The operator states that the value on the left of `??`
will be used if not equal to `null` or `undefined`, else use the expression to the right. See the example below:

```js
let y = null,
z = 5;

// x === z === 5
let x = y ?? z;

y = 55;

// x === y === 55
x = y ?? z;
```

The `??` operator can replace uses of `||` when trying to use a default value, which gives better behaviour for falsy values.

```js
// ?? is better than using || as it avoids falsy behaviours
let x = 0;

// total === x === 0.5 -> unlikely to be intended
let total = x || 0.5;

// total === x === 0
total = x ?? 0.5;
```

### Combining the two operators

Finally, the two operators can be combined to set a default value when `null` or `undefined` are encountered.

```js
let person = {
  name: 'Chris',
  details: undefined
},
x = 5;

// personsAge === x === 5;
let personsAge = person.details?.age ?? x;
```

*Hopefully* you've learnt something new, or if not confirmed your understanding of operators that you use in your daily development.
