It's been a while since I wrote a blog post, and so I thought I'd return with a relatively light subject. I was recently
discussing with friends whether I believe individuals have the right to end their own life. This is following some of
the [UK Governments introductionsof bills](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10123/) that would:

| “allow adults who are terminally ill, subject to safeguards and protections, to request and be provided with assistance to end their own life”

### When is Life not Worth Living?

This is a very controversial and personal topic, but for me I would define it as the physical adjustment to the point where
I no longer am continuously the same person. For instance, in the case of Dementia, I define my personhood as the experiences
and memories that have shaped me up until the current point in time. Alzheimer's as a disease slowly corrupts those neural
pathways that have been built over time, almost deleting disk space at random from your brains storage. However, at what point
does an individual no longer match the person they were previously? If tomorrow I receive a concussion and no longer remember what
I did last week, does that mean I am no longer the same person I was prior?

For these cases I like to defer to Derek Parfit's view of psychological connectedness and continuity. Although a concussion
may lead to reduced connectedness, there is still continuity linking memories together, ensuring the 'self' remains.

This in turn leads to my (personal) belief that in the case of Alzheimer's or other debilitating neurological diseases,
an individual should have the ability to end their life of their own choosing before they eventually debilitate to no
longer be the same person.
