Git as a version control system has usage across the world, but many developers still limit themselves, staying
within mainstay commands. This article will investigate these litany of commands, and hopefully increase your
understanding and productivity.

### Merge

For example, take a common development team example. A team member has created a branch from **master**, and
added new functionality to print their name when the application runs. While the developer has been doing this,
the master branch has been advanced with 5 more features, leaving the new feature branch out-of-sync. A common
practice is to therefore run **git merge**, creating a new single commit in the feature branch, which
collects all the commits made since the feature branch was diverged from **master**.

This does have its pitfalls though. Given a large team where changes are consistently being pushed to the
**master** branch, the feature branch will have a high number of merge commits polluting its history. This
can be filtered away with an advanced **git log**, but without it, it may be confusing for other developers looking
at your code to quickly understand where changes were made.

### Rebase

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Similar to merge,
**rebase** can be used to integrate changes from one branch, into another. However, unlike merge (which is a
non-destructive operation), rebase is used to move the entire **feature** branch, to the tip of the **master** branch,
incorporating all the previous commits from the **master** branch. This removes the need for unnecessary
commits from a merge, leaving a linear project history.

#### Pushing

However, any complex operations that squash commits, or reset/rebase your branch require a force push to the remote
branch.

Therefore, you can run:

```bash
git push --force origin my-feature-branch
```

However, when working on shared branches this can potentially overwrite changes made by other contributors.

A safer alternative that does not overwrite any work on the remote branch is:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin my-feature-branch
```

### Squashing Commits

There are times when you realise after you've committed a new feature, you still need to make some changes.
Commonly, a developer will make the change, and commit it to the branch, like so:

```bash
$ git log
commit d84b3e1f899d48c49e8f513302293ff36d1b0421 (HEAD -> master)

    [master] | Altering Git instruction

commit 0db3d898d87770b47a85c56c61a46bc46343e30a

```

This has needlessly increased the size of the git history, with lots of commits adding nothing. In this case
it is preferable to combine commits `d84b3e`,`6a4e34b`, and `bd0a16d`. A commit
squash or fix can therefore be performed. This involves moving the commit/s into their parent node in the commit
tree. A **squash** will aggregate the commit messages of the combined commits, whilst a fix will
ignore them completely.

As a side-note, rebasing does not actually alter the already made commits (as this is not possible in **git**
through common commands), it creates new ones whilst removing any references to the old ones.

```bash
$ git rebase -i 0db3d898d87770b47a85c56c61a46bc46343e30a
pick bd0a16d [master] | Altering Git instruction
f 6a4e34b [master] | Furthering altering Git instruction
f d84b3e1 [master] | Removing unused line

$ git log
commit dc08bbe95d71a0079f080d326376e2029f11ce3f (HEAD -> master)

Here we can see from the **git log** that `d84b3e` and `6a4e34b` have been now moved inside `d84b3e`.
