When deploying this blog I wanted a quick way to monitor that specific versions of the blog had rolled to the public.
The eventual solution is outlined below.

### Versioning package.json

Using the [pre-commit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pre-commit) package a hook can be setup that runs prior to any commit.
This looks like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "patch": "npm version --no-commit-hooks --no-git-tag-version patch && git add package*.json",
},
```

- `commit-hooks`: Disable any default node hooks which could interfere
- `git-tag-version`: Creates a version commit and tag - I wanted the version change to be part of the existing commit
- `git add package*.json`: Add the updated versioning files to the commit

### Going Meta

To then display this version as part of the `<meta>` required some small tweaks.

```js title="next.config.js"
const { version } = require('./package.json');

module.exports = {
  ...mdx,
  publicRuntimeConfig: {
    version,
  }
}
```

```tsx title="Layout.tsx"
import Head from 'next/head';
import getConfig from 'next/config'; 

const { publicRuntimeConfig } = getConfig();

const Layout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Head>
      <meta name='version' content={publicRuntimeConfig?.version} />
    </Head>
  );
};
```

And voil√† - the version now appears in the header:

```html
<head>
  <meta name="version" content="0.1.65">
</head>
```
